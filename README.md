# NBAOpinion
This web tool scrapes through comment data on NBA teams subreddits. In particular the discussions that partake within a POST GAME THREAD. 


## Purpose

  We set out to create a web tool that would allow us to utilize web scraping as well as User Interface construction skills to analyze how fan bases of NBA teams view players on their roster.
  
## Structure 
  The main structure of our code revolves on getting the post ID's of POST MATCH GAME THREADS. Then using sentiment analysis we catalog the data into a visual for the user to see.
